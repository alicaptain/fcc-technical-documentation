        <h2>Commodore MAX</h2>
        <p>
          In 1982, Commodore released the Commodore MAX Machine in Japan. It was
          called the Ultimax in the United States and VC-10 in Germany. The MAX
          was intended to be a game console with limited computing capability
          and was based on a cut-down version of the hardware family later used
          in the C64. The MAX was discontinued months after its introduction
          because of poor sales in Japan.

        <h2>Commodore Educator 64</h2>
        <p>
          1983 saw Commodore attempt to compete with the Apple II's hold on the
          US education market with the Educator 64,[63] essentially a C64 and
          "greenscale" monochrome monitor in a PET case. Schools preferred the
          all-in-one metal construction of the PET over the standard C64's
          separate components, which could be easily damaged, vandalized, or
          stolen.[64] Schools did not prefer the Educator 64 to the wide range
          of software and hardware options the Apple IIe was able to offer, and
          it was produced in limited quantities.

        <h2>SX-64</h2>
        <p>
          Also in 1983, Commodore released the SX-64, a portable version of the
          C64. The SX-64 has the distinction of being the first commercial
          full-color portable computer.[66] While earlier computers using this
          form factor only incorporate monochrome ("green screen") displays, the
          base SX-64 unit features a 5 in (130 mm) color cathode-ray tube (CRT)
          and one integrated 1541 floppy disk drive. Even though Commodore
          claimed in advertisements that it would have dual 1541 drives, when
          the SX-64 was released there was only one and the other became a
          floppy disk storage slot. Also, unlike most other C64s, the SX-64 does
          not have a datasette connector so an external cassette was not an
          option.

        <h2>Commodore 128</h2>
        <p>
          Two designers at Commodore, Fred Bowen and Bil Herd, were determined
          to rectify the problems of the Plus/4. They intended that the eventual
          successors to the C64—the Commodore 128 and 128D computers (1985)—were
          to build upon the C64, avoiding the Plus/4's flaws.[68][69] The
          successors had many improvements such as a BASIC with graphics and
          sound commands (like almost all home computers not made by Commodore
          [70][71][72]), 80-column display ability, and full CP/M compatibility.
          The decision to make the Commodore 128 plug compatible with the C64
          was made quietly by Bowen and Herd, software and hardware designers
          respectively, without the knowledge or approval by the management in
          the post Jack Tramiel era. The designers were careful not to reveal
          their decision until the project was too far along to be challenged or
          changed and still make the impending Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
          in Las Vegas.[68] Upon learning that the C128 was designed to be
          compatible with the C64, Commodore's marketing department
          independently announced that the C128 would be 100% compatible with
          the C64, thereby raising the bar for C64 support. In a case of
          malicious compliance, the 128 design was altered to include a separate
          "64 mode" using a complete C64 environment to try to ensure total
          compatibility.[citation needed]

        <h2>Commodore 64C</h2>
        <p>
          The C64's designers intended the computer to have a new, wedge-shaped
          case within a year of release, but the change did not occur.[6] In
          1986, Commodore released the 64C computer, which is functionally
          identical to the original. The exterior design was remodeled in the
          sleeker style of the Commodore 128.[48] The 64C uses new versions of
          the SID, VIC-II, and I/O chips being deployed. Models with the C64E
          board had the graphic symbols printed on the top of the keys, instead
          of the normal location on the front. The sound chip (SID) was changed
          to use the MOS 8580 chip, with the core voltage reduced from 12V to
          9V. The most significant changes include different behavior in the
          filters and in the volume control, which result in some music/sound
          effects sounding differently than intended, and in digitally-sampled
          audio being almost inaudible, respectively (though both of these can
          mostly be corrected-for in software). The 64 KB RAM memory went from
          eight chips to two chips. BASIC and the KERNAL went from two separate
          chips into one 16 KB ROM chip. The PLA chip and some TTL chips were
          integrated into a DIL 64-pin chip. The "252535-01" PLA integrated the
          color RAM as well into the same chip. The smaller physical space made
          it impossible to put in some internal expansions like a
          floppy-speeder.[73] In the United States, the 64C was often bundled
          with the third-party GEOS graphical user interface (GUI)-based
          operating system, as well as the software needed to access Quantum
          Link. The 1541 drive received a matching face-lift, resulting in the
          1541C. Later, a smaller, sleeker 1541-II model was introduced, along
          with the 800 KB[74] 3.5-inch microfloppy 1581.

        <h2>Games System</h2>
        <p>
          In 1990, the C64 was repackaged in the form of a game console, called
          the C64 Games System (C64GS), with most external connectivity
          removed.[75] A simple modification to the 64C's motherboard was made
          to allow cartridges to be inserted from above. A modified ROM replaced
          the BASIC interpreter with a boot screen to inform the user to insert
          a cartridge. Designed to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment
          System and the Sega Master System, it suffered from very low sales
          compared to its rivals. It was another commercial failure for
          Commodore, and it was never released outside Europe. The Commodore
          game system lacked a keyboard, so any software that requires a
          keyboard could not be used.

        <h2>Commodore 65</h2>
        <p>
          In 1990, an advanced successor to the C64, the Commodore 65 (also
          known as the "C64DX"), was prototyped, but the project was canceled by
          Commodore's chairman Irving Gould in 1991. The C65's specifications
          were impressive for an 8-bit computer, bringing specs comparable to
          the 16-bit Apple IIGS. For example, it could display 256 colors on the
          screen, while OCS based Amigas could only display 64 in HalfBrite mode
          (32 colors and half-bright transformations). Although no specific
          reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it would have competed in
          the marketplace with Commodore's lower-end Amigas and the Commodore
          CDTV.

      <section id="software" class="main-section">
        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
          In 1982, the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were rivaled only
          by the Atari 8-bit family and appeared exceptional when compared with
          the widely publicized Atari VCS and Apple II. The C64 is often
          credited with starting the computer subculture known as the demoscene
          (see Commodore 64 demos). It is still being actively used in the
          demoscene,[76] especially for music (its SID sound chip even being
          used in special sound cards for PCs, and the Elektron SidStation
          synthesizer). Even though other computers quickly caught up with it,
          the C64 remained a strong competitor to the later video game consoles
          Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Sega Master System, thanks in
          part to its by-then established software base, especially outside
          North America, where it comprehensively outsold the NES.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of lower incomes and the domination of the Sinclair Spectrum
          in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes. Few
          cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983 and, in North
          America, the diskette was the principal method of software
          distribution. The cartridge slot on the C64 was also mainly a feature
          used in the computer's first two years on the US market and became
          rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives
          improved. A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges
          to get around the 16 KB memory limit.

        <h2>BASIC</h2>
        <p>
          As is common for home computers of the early 1980s, the C64 comes with
          a BASIC interpreter, in ROM. KERNAL, I/O, and tape/disk drive
          operations are accessed via custom BASIC language commands. The disk
          drive has its own interfacing microprocessor and ROM (firmware) I/O
          routines, much like the earlier CBM/PET systems and the Atari 400 and
          Atari 800. This means that no memory space is dedicated to running a
          disk operating system, as was the case with earlier systems such as
          the Apple II and TRS-80.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commodore BASIC 2.0 is used instead of the more advanced BASIC 4.0
          from the PET series, since C64 users were not expected to need the
          disk-oriented enhancements of BASIC 4.0. The company did not expect
          many to buy a disk drive, and using BASIC 2.0 simplified VIC-20
          owners' transition to the 64.[77] "The choice of BASIC 2.0 instead of
          4.0 was made with some soul-searching, not just at random. The typical
          user of a C64 is not expected to need the direct disk commands as much
          as other extensions, and the amount of memory to be committed to BASIC
          were to be limited. We chose to leave expansion space for color and
          sound extensions instead of the disk features. As a result, you will
          have to handle the disk in the more cumbersome manner of the 'old
          days'."[78]
        </p>
        <p>
          The version of Microsoft BASIC is not very comprehensive and does not
          include specific commands for sound or graphics manipulation, instead
          requiring users to use the "PEEK and POKE" commands to access the
          graphics and sound chip registers directly. To provide extended
          commands, including graphics and sound, Commodore produced two
          different cartridge-based extensions to BASIC 2.0:
